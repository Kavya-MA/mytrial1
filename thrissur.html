      <h3>About Thrissur:-</h3>
    <p>The term Thrissur is the abbreviated anglicized form of the Malayalam word ‘THRISSIVAPERUR’ which means the town of the “SACRED SIVA”. The town is built on an elevated ground, at the apex of which is the famous “VADAKKUMNATHAN” Temple. A place of great antiquity, Thrissur was also known as “VRISHABHADRIPURAM” and “TEN KAILASAM” in ancient days.

    <h3>Athirapally and Vazhachal waterfalls</h3>
<p> As you walk down the stone slabs that lead to the base of the Athirappilly waterfalls, a mysterious serenity overcomes you. It is Kerala's most famous and largest waterfall at over 80 ft high. The sight of the water crashing onto the ground leaves you with a sense of wonder at the sheer power and magnificence of nature. Located around 63 km from Thrissur district, it is a perennial picnic spot for people in the area and  beyond. Its surrounding greenery is perfect for walks and picnics with loved ones. Lying at the entrance to the Sholayar forest ranges, it is a part of the Chalakudy River which calls the Western Ghats its home.

    Barely 5 km away is another family favourite, Vazhachal Waterfalls. These waterfalls became famous for not just their view but the endemic species found in the surrounding dense forests. Researchers have found four endangered species of the Hornbill here, the only place they thrive in the entire Western Ghats. Ornithologists attach great significance to this location and bird watchers can come across many rare and vibrant species in these parts. </p>
