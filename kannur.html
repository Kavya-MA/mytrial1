    <h3>Madayippara</h3>
<p>Perched upon a hillock near Pazhayagandi in the scenic city of Kannur, Madayipara is renowned as one of the most beautiful landscapes in the entire state of Kerala. Often compared with the famous Tulip Gardens of Amsterdam, Madayipara is better known as 'the land of flowers'. This mystical land is one that changes its appearance with the seasons. The springs decorate the entire hillock in a spectacular gown of vivaciously coloured flora. As the summer approaches, the hillock shapeshifts into a glamorous golden field filled with knee-high grass. Come autumn, the place is dotted with leaves that paint the field a raging crimson red. The monsoons lift up this hill station's spirits and decorate the whole 700 acres in striking shades of green. These stunning changes adapted by Madayipara have aroused the interest of countless tourists around the world who come here to witness this extraordinary phenomenon.

    Decorated with a luxuriant variety of 300 flowering plants and more than 30 species of thick grass, Madayipara is no less than a heaven for nature lovers. This rich ecology draws the attention of 150 different species of stunning butterflies that charm you with their mind-boggling designs and vivid colours, including the Atlas butterfly - the world's biggest butterfly. Over 100 species of birds, both endemic and migratory, call Madayipara their home and make this hill station a bird lover's paradise.</p>

            <h3>Payyabalam Beach</h3>
            <p>The impeccably unspoiled Payyabalam beach is adorned with sparkling pearls of golden sand and foamy white waves of the Arabian Sea. The highlight of Kannur and one of the many beautiful beaches of Kerala, the Payyabalam beach has an incredibly peaceful and inviting aura. Unwind after a long week by relaxing at this remarkable seashore and find yourself mesmerized by its elegant beauty and contagious calm. The approach to the beach is through a small crossover bridge that is built over a narrow canal. To the right of the bridge are the memorials of Kannur's important political personalities that had passed away over the recent decades. 

                Palm trees and casuarinas embellish the shores like an alluring garland in various shades of green. This pristine golden beach is not only great for relaxing and revitalizing yourself, but also for boating, swimming, and thrilling adventure activities! The rhythmic dance of the turquoise waters is so inviting that you are bound to be tempted to take a dip. Boating and indulging in some adventure sports will allow you to wade deeper into these alluring waters. The Payyamballam Beach spreads its reach for about 4 kms and is nothing short of paradise on earth. </p>
